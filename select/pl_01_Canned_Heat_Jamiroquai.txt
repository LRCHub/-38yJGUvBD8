You know this boogie is for real
I used to put my faith in
worship
But then my chance TO GET to
Heaven slipped
I used to worry about the future
But then I threw my caution to
the wind
I had no reason to be care free
no, no, no
Until I took a trip to the
other side of town
yeah, yeah,yeah
You know I heard that boogie
rhythm, hey
I had no choice but to get down
down down down
Dance, woah
Nothing left for me to do
but dance
Off these bad times I'm going
through just dance
Got canned heat in my heels
tonight baby
I feel the thunder see the
lightning
I know this anger's heaven sent
So I've got to hang out all my
hang-ups
Because of the boogie I feel so
hell bent, hey hey
It's just an instant gut
reaction, that I got
I know I never ever felt like
this before
I don't know what to do
But then that's nothing new
Stuck between hell and high
water
I need a cure to make it through
Hey, dance
Nothing left for me to do but,
dance
All these bad times I'm going
through, just dance…Hey
got canned heat in my heals
tonight baby
You know I've got canned heat
up my heels
You know this boogie is for
real…
Only the wind can blow the
answer
And she cries to me when I'm
asleep
She says you know that you can
go much faster
I know that peoples' talk can
be so cheap (hey)
I got this voodoo child
inveined on me
I'm gonna use my power to ascend
You know I got these running
heels to use
Sometimes there's no way to lose
I was born to run and built
to last
You've never seen my feet
they can go so fast
Dance…yeah hey
nothing left for me to do
but, dance
All these bad times I'm going
through, just dance, hey
Got canned heat in my heels
tonight baby
Dance
Hey DJ let the music play
I'm gonna let this party live
Hey DJ throw my cares away
I'm gonna live this party live
Hey DJ let the music play
I'm gonna let this party live
Hey DJ throw my cares away
I'm gonna let this party live
you know this boogie
is for real
Got so much canned heat in my
heels
Gonna dance, gonna dance my
blues away tonight
Whooooo
You know, you know this boogie,
this boogie is for real
Got so much canned heat, canned
heat in my heels
