[00:19.33] You know this boogie is for real
[00:26.96] I used to put my faith in worship
[00:30.70] But then my chance to get to heaven slipped
[00:34.27] I used to worry about the future
[00:38.18] But then I threw my caution to the wind
[00:41.91] I had no reason to be care free, no, no, no
[00:45.77] Until I took a trip to the other side of town, yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:49.40] You know I heard that boogie rhythm, hey
[00:53.15] I had no choice but to get down, down, down, down
[00:56.74] DANCE! Nothing left for me to do but DANCE!
[01:01.85] All these bad times I'm going through just DANCE!
[01:05.87] Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
[01:11.97] I feel the thunder, see the lightning
[01:15.74] I know this anger's heaven sent
[01:19.08] So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
[01:23.27] Because of the boogie I feel so hell bent, hey, hey
[01:26.98] It's just an instant gut reaction, that I got
[01:30.63] I know I never ever felt like this before
[01:33.93] I don't know what to do but then that's nothing new
[01:37.48] Stuck between hell and high water I need a cure to make it through
[01:41.36] Hey, DANCE! Nothing left for me to do but DANCE!
[01:46.92] All these bad times I'm going through just DANCE!
[01:49.97] Hey, got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
[01:54.42] You know, know, know I'm gonna DANCE! Yeah
[01:57.96] All the nasty things that people say
[02:00.40] DANCE! Yeah, but I'm gonna make it anyway

[02:27.97] 
[02:27.16] Only the wind can blow the answer
[02:30.61] And she cries to me when I'm asleep
[02:33.70] She says you know that you can go much faster
[02:37.73] I know that peoples' talk can be so cheap, hey
[02:41.82] I got this voodoo child in veined on me
[02:45.77] I'm gonna use my power to ascend
[02:48.72] You know I got these running heels to use
[02:51.03] Sometimes there's no way I lose, I was born to run and built to last
